5 March 2019 - 21 March 2019

DATA:
The associated files 3LetterWords.* are identical in content. They
do only vary in their format.
The files contain a lot of “words” of 3 letters. It is upper- as well as
lower-case letters and special characters.

EXERCISE:
Do a full UP process on the project incl. diagrams.

 
1)  Create database tables for the words and import the words into
    the database table
    
2)  Design and implement a Java program, which can:
    a) read in these words from the database into Java ADT (set,
    map, list)
    b) filter them to a standard (e.g. no special chars, all lowercase,
    ...)
    c) write to new table(s) so they are unique and easy to search
    in. You are welcome to include further information. 


3)  Design and implement a Java program, which use the result table
    from I: 
    to find 3 letters cross word puzzles, where each letter is
    unique.
    The implementation can make the most use of Java different data
    structures e.g. from the Collection classes.


4)  Repeat II: but this time, with class(es) made by you through
    inheritance.
    That is - rethink your solution from II and extract which services
    YOU want from this/these new class(es).


5)  How many different crosswords is your program capable of
    creating?
    How much time does it take?
    
    
    DATABASE Optimization:
Consider optimization of the Algorithm:
How could the word list be split into several tables to minimize the
number of combinations to try?
